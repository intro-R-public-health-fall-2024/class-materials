Class materials for Intro to R for Public Health, Fall 2024

This repository will contain all the in-class lecture notes and exercises.

You will want to "pull" from this repository each week to get the latest class materials. You don't need to create a new project in RStudio each time; just update the existing one you have.

Welcome to the course!
